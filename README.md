The OWASP ZAP of 2021 is the available result of the latest research centered on a deep examination of data compiled from over forty partner organizations. It is aimed to be used equally to those new to application security as well as professional infiltration testers._


An OWASP ZAP check can reveal issues relating to SQL injection, wrecked authentication, complex data exposure, broken access controls, security misconfigurations, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), insecure deserialization, components with known vulnerabilities, and any missing security headers.

OWASP ZAP is ultimately a proxy server that scans all the traffic that runs through it. This proxy server consists of auto canners that let you intercept vulnerabilities on your website and produce reports from its findings. Here is a quick diagram of how ZAP works.
